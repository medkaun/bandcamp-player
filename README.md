This is an app to play an album from bandcamp on shuffle.
For now it works just when Chrome is installed and it doesn't skip songs automatically, therefore it's not very practical YET - however, fun to do and I'm sure I will come up with how to make it better.

I used the audio player tutorial by Papa Moryba Kouate from here: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-an-mp3-music-player-with-python-619e0c0dcee2
And then changed some things.

P.S. I thought of making it that you could log in and play your entire library on shuffle but then bandcamp started asking me many times if I'm a robot, which is understandable. But imagine that, super cool!
